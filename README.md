Creative Tilt

Something interesting about our game is that when the ball hits the paddle a function determines weather
the ball is closer to the left side, right side, or directly in the middle of the skateboard.
As well, that the ball's velocity is changed by the difference. An artistic choice we is that when the function runs it plays
a small animation of the skateboard rolling over whenever it hits, to suggest the ball and skateboard has collided.
